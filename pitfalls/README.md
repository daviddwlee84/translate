# Pitfalls

Past traps we've stepped on. **Symptoms-first** knowledge base — when a
problem recurs (on a new machine, after an upgrade, with a new tool combo),
grepping the symptom here lands you on the root cause and workaround in
seconds, instead of re-debugging from scratch.

This folder is maintainer-facing repo metadata. It lives in the git repo but
never reaches users — `go install` / `go build` compile only Go sources, so
`TODO.md`, `backlog/`, and `pitfalls/` have no effect on the built binary.

## Pitfalls vs the rest

| Surface | Time direction | Question it answers | Access pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/<tool>.md` | Present | "How does this tool work / how do I configure it?" | Read top to bottom |
| `pitfalls/<slug>.md` | **Past** | **"I see error X — has this happened before?"** | **Grep symptoms** |
| `backlog/<slug>.md` | Future | "We thought about doing Y — what was the analysis?" | Index in `TODO.md` |
| `AGENTS.md` Hard invariants | Present | "What rules MUST agents follow?" | Read top to bottom |

A pitfall **graduates** to a Hard invariant when the trap is serious enough
that you can't rely on memory or grep — typically when (a) it recurs across
machines, (b) it silently corrupts state, or (c) the workaround is non-obvious
and easy to undo by accident. When graduating, leave a `pitfalls/<slug>.md`
as historical record and link to it from the new invariant.

## When to add a pitfall doc

Add `pitfalls/<slug>.md` when you've spent more than ~15 minutes on something
that wasn't googleable, AND any of:

- The symptom is non-obvious from the root cause (silent state, weird side
  effect, behaviour change without error)
- The fix is "do nothing different but in a specific order"
- The same trap could be hit by a new agent / new machine / new contributor
- An upstream bug exists with no ETA — workaround needs to outlive memory
- A specific tool version is required (or forbidden) and failure at the
  wrong version is silent / confusing

## When NOT to add a pitfall doc

- Trivially googleable (next person solves in 30 seconds)
- Already covered in `docs/<tool>.md` — cross-link from this README's
  "Cross-referenced pitfalls" table below instead of duplicating
- Already a Hard invariant (cross-link only)
- One-off transient (network glitch, machine-specific config rot)

## File template

See [`pitfall-doc.md.template`] in the
[`project-knowledge-harness` skill](https://github.com/daviddwlee84/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/local/project-knowledge-harness)
for the per-doc template.

Key sections (different from `backlog/` template — symptom-first, not
context-first):

```markdown
# <Title describing the SYMPTOM, not the root cause>

**Symptoms** (grep this section): <verbatim error messages, observable behaviour>
**First seen**: YYYY-MM
**Affects**: <tool/version/OS combo>
**Status**: workaround documented / fixed upstream in vX.Y / WONTFIX

## Symptom

Full error messages (verbatim — preserves grep-ability).

## Root cause

Why this happens, with source/docs/upstream issue link.

## Workaround

Copy-pasteable commands or config diff.

## Prevention

How to avoid stepping on this again.

## Related

Links to docs, sibling pitfalls, TODO entries, upstream issues.
```

## Index

Pitfalls owned by this folder. Keep alphabetical.

| Slug | Symptom keywords | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `duplicate-translate-on-path-dotfiles-bin-shadows-local-bin` | two `translate` on PATH, `command -v -a`, reinstall has no effect, `~/.dotfiles/bin` shadows `~/.local/bin` | workaround; fix in TODO P2 |
| `go-install-module-path-mismatch` | `module declares its path as: translate`, `but was required as`, `parsing go.mod` | fixed (module renamed) |
| `gobin-points-at-mise-toolchain-dir` | binary vanishes after Go upgrade, `go env GOBIN` = `.../mise/installs/go/<ver>/bin` | workaround (pin GOBIN) |
| `llm-stream-truncation-silently-rendered-as-complete` | translation cut mid-word / half output, no error, `detected:` line still shown, streamed result truncated, copilot-proxy SSE dropped | fixed (assert stream completeness) |
| `tui-viewport-clips-long-translation-no-softwrap` | TUI translation cut mid-sentence but CLI/curl shows full text, no `⚠`, long/multi-line results clipped, viewport SoftWrap | fixed (SoftWrap=true) |

## Cross-referenced pitfalls (still in their original homes)

These traps are documented elsewhere and aren't duplicated here — the table
exists so grepping `pitfalls/` still finds them. Move into this folder only
if their original location stops being a natural reading flow.

| Trap | Lives in | Why not here |
|---|---|---|
| (example: Tool X version Y bug) | `docs/tool-x.md` → "Known issues" | Already part of the tool's normal config narrative |

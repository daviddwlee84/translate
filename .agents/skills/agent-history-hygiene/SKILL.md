description: Commit SpecStory chat transcripts (`.specstory/history/*.md`), Claude Code plan files (`.claude/plans/*.md`, `plansDirectory`), and other coding-agent artifacts (`.cursor/plans/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.opencode/plans/`, `.specify/`, `.codex/`) alongside the feature diff they produced — without leaking `.env` contents, API keys, or private-key PEM blocks into git history. Use when the user says "commit my chat", "save this specstory session", "stage the plan file", "scrub the transcript", "my .env leaked in chat", "bootstrap pre-commit for this project", or when you notice untracked `.specstory/history/*.md` or `.claude/plans/*.md` files while running `git status`. Also use after an accidental push of a secret to enforce rotate-first, rewrite-last remediation instead of reflexive `git push --force`.

# agent-history-hygiene

Keep agent chat transcripts and plan files committed together with the
code they produced, without leaking secrets. Pairs with the
`redact-agent-secrets` + `gitleaks` pre-commit hooks the skill installs.

Three surfaces, separated by purpose:

| Surface                          | Question it answers                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find-session.sh`                | "Which transcript / plan file is *my* current session?"      |
| `stage-agent-artifacts.sh`       | "Which agent files belong in the next commit?"               |
| `bootstrap-project.sh`           | "How do I get pre-commit + gitleaks + redactor into a repo?" |
| `scan-staged.sh`                 | "Is there a leaked secret in what I'm about to commit?"      |
| `references/remediation.md`      | "I already pushed a secret — now what?"                      |

## Core invariants

1. **Agent transcripts and plan files are committed alongside the diff
   that produced them.** Never add them to `.gitignore`. An agent that
   drops these from a commit has broken the user's review trail.
2. **Rotate at the provider before any git rewrite.** The only act
   that revokes a leaked credential is rotation. History rewriting
   scrubs bytes on one clone and leaves them on every other.
3. **`git push --force` against a shared branch is never the fix for a
   leak.** At best it's useless; at worst it destroys teammate work and
   silently re-introduces the secret when someone merges their old
   history back.

## When to use this skill

Use it when the user (or you) surface any of:

- "Commit my chat" / "save the specstory session" / "include the plan
  file in this commit" / "把 plan 跟 specstory 一起 commit 進去".
- You see dirty `.specstory/history/*.md`, `.claude/plans/*.md`,
  `.cursor/plans/*.md`, or any other configured agent artifact during
  `git status` and you're about to commit a feature.
- "Scrub this transcript" / "redact my key" / "gitleaks flagged my
  chat history".
- "Set up pre-commit for this repo" / "I'm starting a new project — how
  do I get the hook stack?" / "bootstrap secret scanning here".
- "I pushed a `.env`" / "a secret went to main" / "do I need to force
  push?" — the agent must steer to `references/remediation.md` and
  stop the user from force-pushing reflexively.

## When NOT to use

- The user explicitly wants agent transcripts **excluded** from the
  repo. Respect that; suggest a one-liner `.gitignore` addition and
  skip this skill entirely.
- The leak is already on a shared `main`/release branch. Do **not**
  offer to rewrite history — jump to `references/remediation.md` §5.
- The project genuinely has no agent session (no `.specstory/`, no
  `.claude/plans/`, etc.). Nothing to stage.
- Single-file, single-commit hygiene that the agent handles without any
  script (e.g., adding a missing trailing newline).

## Integration with existing infrastructure

This skill sits **on top of** any chezmoi-managed stack the user
already has. It does not duplicate:

- **chezmoi's global `core.hooksPath`** (`~/.config/git/hooks/pre-commit`)
  — that wrapper runs the repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and then
  optionally `gitleaks git --staged`. The skill bootstraps the repo-level
  config the wrapper expects to find.
- **chezmoi's `.gitleaks.toml`** — the user's config already carries
  curated rules for common API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Supabase,
  Linear, WakaTime, Cursor, HuggingFace, Notion, Tailscale, Clash /
  V2Ray tokens). The skill's `assets/gitleaks.toml.template` ships the
  same rule IDs so `.gitleaksignore` / allowlist tweaks stay portable.
- **chezmoi's `scripts/redact_secrets.py`** — remains the upstream
  source of truth. The skill bundles a copy so non-chezmoi users get
  protection; sync procedure in
  [`references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md`](references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md).

What this skill **adds**:

- Agent-facing discipline (this `SKILL.md` + `references/remediation.md`).
- A single-command project bootstrap (`bootstrap-project.sh`) for repos
  without chezmoi or where the user wants the stack in one go.
- Session-discovery heuristics (`find-session.sh`) for the "find my
  current transcript among many" problem.
- An exit-code wrapper (`scan-staged.sh`) agents can branch on before
  committing.

## Workflow A: commit-time hygiene

Default flow when the agent is about to commit feature changes plus
chat/plan artifacts.

```bash
# 1. Make sure the agent knows which session is "ours" — mostly
#    relevant when multiple Claude/SpecStory sessions run in the repo.
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/find-session.sh

# 2. Stage code the usual way, then auto-add agent artifacts.
git add path/to/feature/file.ts
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/stage-agent-artifacts.sh
# Use --session-only if you want ONLY the current SpecStory + newest plan;
# default stages every dirty *.md in every configured agent dir.

# 3. Belt-and-suspenders secret scan before commit. Exit 0 = clean.
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/scan-staged.sh || {
  # Exit 10/20: leaks found. Jump to references/remediation.md.
  echo "Leaks detected — see references/remediation.md before committing." >&2
  exit 1
}

# 4. Commit. pre-commit (installed by bootstrap) runs redact-agent-secrets
#    then gitleaks again as a catch-all.
git commit -m "feat: ..."
```

## Workflow B: bootstrap a new project

For repos that don't yet have `.pre-commit-config.yaml` / `.gitleaks.toml`
installed. Runs once per repo.

```bash
cd /path/to/new/project
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/bootstrap-project.sh \
  --install-hook            # optional: auto-stage on every commit

# Verify: shake out any existing issues in the working tree.
pre-commit run --all-files
```

What `bootstrap-project.sh` does:

1. Drops `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.gitleaks.toml` into the repo
   (skips if already present unless `--force`).
2. Writes `scripts/redact_secrets.py` (bundled copy; use
   `--from-chezmoi` to symlink the chezmoi source so fixes propagate).
3. Runs `pre-commit install` (or `uvx pre-commit@4 install` if
   pre-commit isn't on `PATH`).
4. Audits `.gitignore` / `.git/info/exclude` for patterns that would
   silently hide an agent artifact dir — warns without editing.
5. Checks `~/.claude/settings.json` for `plansDirectory`; prints the
   one-line patch if missing.
6. With `--install-hook`: writes a `prepare-commit-msg` hook that calls
   `stage-agent-artifacts.sh --session-only --allow-empty` so every
   `git commit` auto-attaches the current session file.

## Workflow C: post-leak remediation

When `scan-staged.sh` reports exit `10`/`20`, or the user says "I
committed / pushed a secret":

1. **STOP** the user from running `git push --force` reflexively.
2. Read `references/remediation.md` end-to-end.
3. Walk the user through **step 1 (rotate)** regardless of blast
   radius. Only after rotation does the question of scrubbing history
   become worth discussing.
4. Use the decision tree in the runbook to pick the right git action.

## Gotchas

- **`plansDirectory` project-level sometimes ignored.** Claude Code
  issue [#19537](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19537)
  reports project-level `plansDirectory` being ignored in some
  versions. After running a `/plan`, verify the file actually landed
  where you expected before relying on `stage-agent-artifacts.sh`
  picking it up. User-level config (`~/.claude/settings.json` with
  `"plansDirectory": "./.claude/plans"`) is the recommended default.
- **`gitleaks protect` is deprecated.** Since v8.19.0 use
  `gitleaks git --staged --redact` (pre-commit) and
  `gitleaks dir <path>` (working directory). The older commands still
  work but emit a deprecation notice. This skill uses the modern
  syntax everywhere.
- **`pre-commit install` is per-clone.** Each teammate must run
  `pre-commit install` in their own clone for hooks to fire. CI cannot
  be trusted as the single gate — it's second-chance, not last-chance.
- **Transcript files can be huge.** A long SpecStory session can exceed
  2 MB. The template bumps `check-added-large-files` to `--maxkb=2048`
  to avoid false positives, but a very long session can still overflow.
  If you hit the limit, rotate sessions (`specstory run claude`
  creates a fresh file) instead of raising the cap further.
- **Session-UUID divergence between SpecStory CLI and VS Code
  extension.** The extension autosaves into `.specstory/history/`
  continuously; the CLI (`specstory run claude`) creates one file per
  invocation. If both are active you can end up with two transcripts
  for what feels like "one session" — mtime-newest wins in
  `find-session.sh`.
- **Global `core.hooksPath` means bare repos aren't protected.** The
  chezmoi setup's global hook runs `.pre-commit-config.yaml` IF it
  exists — so a repo without `.pre-commit-config.yaml` has no
  protection. Run `bootstrap-project.sh` before the first commit with
  agent artifacts, not after.
- **Active SpecStory writer can defeat the redact loop.** The standard
  `git add → git commit → pre-commit auto-fixes → re-stage → re-commit`
  flow assumes the file is **quiescent** during the commit. SpecStory's
  `specstory_*_watch` daemon tails the agent transcript continuously,
  so if the chat captured `ps -axo args`-style output that contained an
  unrelated daemon's secret in argv (e.g. SpecStory's own
  `--cloud-token …` flag), every diagnostic command (`grep`, `sed -n
  '<line>p'`, `cat | head | tail`) prints the secret again, SpecStory
  appends it to the transcript, and the redact-then-restage cycle
  never converges. Symptom: pre-commit says "Successfully redacted N
  file(s)" but `gitleaks-system` immediately fails on the same line,
  re-running `git add && git commit` doesn't help, and `grep -c
  '<secret-prefix>' file` shows the count *increasing* over commit
  attempts. **Workaround**: a single atomic
  `python3 -c "<in-place re.sub>" && git add <file> && git commit -m
  "..."` pipeline so the index is frozen before any new specstory write
  lands. **Don't** print, grep, or diff the secret line during the
  recovery — every print echoes back into the transcript. Diagnose with
  `lsof <file>` (looking for `specstory_*` writers) instead. See
  `pitfalls/redact-secrets-loop-with-active-specstory-writer.md` in
  upstream chezmoi for the full debugging trail.

## Available scripts

- **`scripts/find-session.sh [--format=specstory|claude|both] [--json]`**
  Discover the current agent session files for `$PWD`. TSV default,
  `--json` for structured callers. Never exits non-zero (always 0,
  empty fields signal absence).

- **`scripts/stage-agent-artifacts.sh [--session-only] [--include-all-plans] [--dry-run] [--allow-empty]`**
  `git add` the right agent artifacts before the next commit.
  `--session-only` stages only the current SpecStory + newest plan;
  default stages every dirty `*.md` in every configured artifact dir.
  Refuses to run if there are no code changes (prevents "commit just
  transcript"); override with `--allow-empty`.

- **`scripts/scan-staged.sh [--redact] [--verbose]`**
  Run `gitleaks git --staged` with agent-friendly exit codes
  (0 clean / 10 redacted / 20 leaks / 30 gitleaks missing). JSON lines
  on stdout, prose diagnostics on stderr.

- **`scripts/bootstrap-project.sh [--from-chezmoi] [--install-hook] [--force] [--dry-run]`**
  Install `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.gitleaks.toml` + the redactor
  into the current repo, then run `pre-commit install`. Audits
  `.gitignore` and `~/.claude/settings.json` for misconfigurations
  (warns, never silently edits).

## Bundled assets

- `assets/artifact-dirs.txt` — the canonical list of agent artifact
  directories (SpecStory, Claude plans, Cursor plans + rules, OpenCode
  plans, Spec-kit, Codex). Consumed by `stage-agent-artifacts.sh` and
  by `bootstrap-project.sh` when rendering the pre-commit `files:`
  regex.
- `assets/pre-commit-config.yaml.template` — minimal
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `redact-agent-secrets` + gitleaks +
  standard hygiene hooks.
- `assets/gitleaks.toml.template` — portable subset of the chezmoi
  `.gitleaks.toml` with custom rule IDs + a path-scoped allowlist for
  agent artifact dirs.
- `assets/redact_secrets.py` — bundled copy of chezmoi's
  `scripts/redact_secrets.py`. Chezmoi version is upstream; sync doc
  in `references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md`.

## Reference files

- [`references/transcript-session-discovery.md`](references/transcript-session-discovery.md)
  — SpecStory / Claude session layouts and the `$PWD → slug` algorithm.
  Read when `find-session.sh` returns empty or ambiguous results.
- [`references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md`](references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md)
  — three-layer defense (redact → gitleaks → `scan-staged.sh`),
  allowlist design, sync procedure for the bundled redactor. Read
  when tuning rules or debugging unexpected pre-commit failures.
- [`references/remediation.md`](references/remediation.md) —
  rotate-first runbook for "I committed / pushed a secret". Read
  **before** any `git filter-repo` / `git push --force` action.

## Tests

The skill ships with a three-level test suite under
[`tests/`](tests/README.md). Run from repo root:

```bash
make test-skill
```

- `test_redact_secrets.py` — pytest for pure redactor functions.
- `test_gitleaks_corpus.py` — golden-corpus fixtures staged in tmp git
  repos, asserting real-key shapes fire and example shapes are
  allowlisted only inside configured artifact dirs.
- `test_scan_staged.sh` — exit-code contract for
  `scripts/scan-staged.sh` (0 / 20 / 30 / 2).

The corpus + shell tests skip gracefully when `gitleaks` isn't on
`PATH`. See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for what each
regression the suite locks in.

- [`project-knowledge-harness`](../project-knowledge-harness/SKILL.md)
  — complementary memory harness (TODO.md + backlog/ + pitfalls/) that
  references `.claude/plans/` as "ephemeral agent scratchpads". This
  skill fills the gap: those scratchpads belong in git, not ignored.

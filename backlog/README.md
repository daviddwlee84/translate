# Backlog Research

Long-form research, design notes, and paused troubleshooting for items listed in
[`../TODO.md`](../TODO.md). One file per topic, named with a slug that matches
the TODO entry.

## Why this exists

`TODO.md` is the **index** — short titles grouped by priority section with
effort tags. This folder
is the **knowledge base** — the actual investigation, options considered,
benchmarks, error messages, and decisions that informed the TODO entry. The goal
is **resume-friendliness**: when you (or an agent) come back to an item three
months later, the doc here lets you pick up in 5 minutes instead of re-running
30 minutes of investigation.

This folder is maintainer-facing repo metadata. It lives in the git repo but
never reaches users — `go install` / `go build` compile only Go sources, so it
has no effect on the built binary.

## When to add a doc here

Add a `backlog/<slug>.md` file when **any** of these apply:

- The TODO item carries a `P?` tag (it requires evaluation; record what was tried)
- You did meaningful troubleshooting but didn't ship a fix (capture the trace
  before it evaporates)
- Multiple options were considered (record the trade-offs, not just the winner)
- An external blocker exists (waiting on upstream release, host availability)
- The implementation is `[L]` or `[XL]` (architectural; needs design before code)

`[S]` items rarely need a doc unless there's surprising context.

## When NOT to add a doc here

- Item is `[S]` and obvious — just put the file path in the TODO entry
- Already covered by an existing doc page (cross-link instead — that's
  user-facing reference, this is maintainer-facing speculation)
- Speculation only ("would be cool to...") with no investigation — keep it as a
  one-liner in `TODO.md` first; promote to a doc when you actually look into it

## File template

See [`backlog-doc.md.template`] in the skill's `assets/` for the per-doc
template, or copy the structure of an existing entry below.

## Index

Add new entries here as you create them. Keep alphabetical.

| Slug | Status | TODO entry |
|---|---|---|
| `bilingual-immersive-mode` | shipped (2026-07) | Done "Bilingual `--bilingual`/`-2` pipe mode…" |
| `chezmoi-go-tool-integration` | spike done, paused on scope (2026-07) | P? "Wire `translate` into chezmoi…" |
| `dict-bundling` | deferred (2026-07) | P? "Bundle or prebuild the dictionary…" |
| `homebrew-distribution` | shipped (2026-07) | Done "Homebrew tap distribution…" |
| `release-binaries` | deferred (2026-07) | P? "Ship prebuilt release binaries…" |
